                As a strategic coaching client, you are most likely to see
                results if you are passionate about learning, open to change,
                willing to be accountable and excited about where this will
                lead. If that sounds like you, and you recognize yourself and

                You are constantly consuming content, reading, watching videos

                You realize you don&#39;t know it all and can't do it alone.
                You're open to receiving help and you leave your ego at the

                My hope is that, through this coaching program, you will create
                a culture of accountability and alignment as well as improved
                communications. Your employees will be happier and more
                productive in the process! And most importantly, you will be on
